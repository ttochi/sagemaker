Let's start the sagemaker demo first

First, log in to AWS console. And connect to sagemaker dashboard. 

You can check the features of sagemaker in this Menu.

And I will use SageMaker Studio which is the kind of IDE that provide the Integrated development environmentÂ of sagemaker.

And open the studio, jupyter lab program will be loaded.
Because the sagemaker studio is extend of the jupyter lab.

We can run the jupyter notebook in this envrionment.

And I prepared some jupyter notebook files for the demo.

I will show you how to train the model for the 4 types of training that explained earlier.

I will train model using built-in algorithm.
And, using user created training script.
And, using user build custom docker image.
And, using the AWS marketplace algorithm.
